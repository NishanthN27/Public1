Implementation Of Run-Length Encoding on the contents of a text file using Singly Linked Lists.

Run-Length Encoding (RLE) compresses data by replacing repeated consecutive characters with a count-value pair. In my program:

->Singly Linked List (SLL) is used to store characters.

->Consecutive occurrences are counted within the list.

->During encoding, it traverses the list, printing count-value pairs and also writing them onto the output text file.
